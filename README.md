# clakr

clakr is an auto-clicker application for macOS that simulates mouse clicks at a specified rate. It allows users to configure the number of clicks per second, as well as set a delay for the start and stop of the clicking action. Additionally, users can define a period during which the mouse must remain stationary before the auto-clicking begins.

## Features

- **Clicks per second**: Set the number of auto-clicks to be performed in one second.
- **Start after (seconds)**: Delay the start of the auto-clicking by a specified number of seconds.
- **Stop after (seconds)**: Automatically stop clicking after a certain period.
- **Stationary for (seconds)**: Wait for the mouse to be stationary for a specified duration before starting to click.

## Usage

To use clakr, adjust the settings to your preference and click the "Start" button. To stop the auto-clicking, press the "Stop" button or use the designated hotkey. Or, if you have the **Stationary for (seconds)**, simply shake your mouse/cursor.

## Installation
