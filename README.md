# clakr

clakr is a sophisticated auto-clicker application designed for macOS. It simulates mouse clicks at user-defined rates, offering a high degree of customization for automated tasks.

## Key Features

- **Configurable Click Rate**: Define the number of clicks per second.
- **Delayed Start**: Initiate clicking after a set period.
- **Automatic Stop**: Cease clicking after a specified duration.
- **Stationary Detection**: Begin clicking only when the mouse has been still for a defined time.

## Performance Analysis

To verify the performance of clakr, you can use our validator script. Follow these steps:

1. Download the validator script from [here](autoclicker-tests/validator/runcals.js).
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
3. Open your command-line interface (CLI).
4. Change the directory to where the validator script is located using the `cd` command. For example:

```sh
cd path/to/autoclicker-tests
```

5. Install the `jstat` package, which is required by the validator, by running:

```sh
npm install jstat
```

6. Open the `runcals.js` file in a text editor and enter the test values and parameters as needed.
7. Execute the validator script with Node.js by running:

```sh
node runcals.js
```

> Replace `runcals.js` with the filename if you have renamed the validator script.
