# Privacy Policy for Clakr

Effective date: April 30, 2024

This Privacy Policy describes how Clakr (referred to as "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our macOS application ("Clakr" or "the app").

## Information We Collect

Clakr is designed with privacy in mind; therefore, it does not collect or transmit any personal information. The app operates entirely offline, except for the following scenarios:

- **Auto-updating**: Clakr checks for updates by pinging `senpaihunters.github.io`. This is the only instance where the app connects to the internet, and no personal data is sent or collected during this process.

## How We Use Information

- **Auto-updating**: To notify you of available updates and ensure that Clakr remains up-to-date with the latest features and security enhancements.

## How We Share Information

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information since Clakr does not gather such data.

## Your Choices

- **Auto-updating**: You can disable auto-updating in the app's settings if you prefer not to connect to the internet for updates.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our processing of your personal data and will always be available within the app.
